    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I don't know about you but with a house full with kids and a husband, my day cannot start properly without a nice cup of joe of some kind! I seriously, think I am a whole different human!
        I love trying different coffees, and lattes! One morning, I was feeling fancy and wanted to get my Starbucks on without paying the Starbucks price!
        I thought to myself hmmm...I love lattes and I love white chocolate, why not make a white chocolate latte! Hence, this beauty was born! Grab your favorite coffee mug, you have to try this!
